## üîç Linux Script Breakdown

### `disk_check_linux.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "======= Disk Health & Usage Report (Linux) ======="
# ‚û§ Prints a heading for the report

echo "Date: $(date)"
# ‚û§ Displays the current date and time

echo

echo "[1] Mounted Filesystems:"
df -h
# ‚û§ Shows usage of all mounted filesystems with human-readable sizes

echo

echo "[2] Disk Inodes:"
df -i
# ‚û§ Displays inode usage, which helps identify inode exhaustion issues (common on servers)

echo

echo "[3] Top 5 Largest Directories in /:"
du -ahx / | sort -rh | head -n 5
# ‚û§ Lists all directories/files under /, sorts them by size (descending), and shows top 5
# ‚û§ Useful for spotting space hogs

echo

echo "[4] Partition Layout:"
lsblk
# ‚û§ Lists all block devices and their partitions (tree structure)

echo

echo "[5] Disk Health (SMART Data):"
sudo smartctl -H /dev/sda
# ‚û§ Shows SMART health status of the main disk (typically /dev/sda)
# ‚û§ Requires `smartmontools` and `sudo` permissions
```

### üîç What This Script Does (Line-by-Line)

| Line                                   | What It Does                                                     |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Write-Host ...`                       | Prints a heading so users know what this section is              |
| `Get-ChildItem C:\ -Directory`         | Gets a list of all **top-level folders** in the `C:\` drive      |
| `-Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` | Includes hidden folders and avoids error spam                    |
| `ForEach-Object { ... }`               | Loops through each folder and performs actions                   |
| `$folderPath = $_.FullName`            | Saves the full folder path                                       |
| `Get-ChildItem $folderPath -Recurse`   | Recursively lists all files/subfolders in that folder            |
| `Measure-Object -Property Length -Sum` | Sums the size of all files in bytes                              |
| `[math]::Round(... / 1GB, 2)`          | Converts the total size to gigabytes and rounds it to 2 decimals |
| `Sort-Object SizeGB -Descending`       | Sorts folders by size, biggest first                             |
| `Select-Object -First 10`              | Returns only the **top 10 largest folders**                      |

### üöÄ Why This Version Rocks

- ‚ö° Much **faster** than scanning the entire drive recursively like the previous version
- üí• Avoids CPU overload and system lag
- ‚úÖ Works on most systems without needing admin rights
- üìä Gives a practical overview of **where your disk space is going**

---

### üß† Example Output

```text
Folder                                SizeGB
------                                ------
C:\Users                              35.42
C:\ProgramData                        15.76
C:\Windows                            11.89
C:\Program Files                      10.55
C:\Temp                               4.33
...
```

### üí° Pro Tip

If you want it even **faster**, avoid recursion entirely and just estimate folder sizes using rough heuristics ‚Äî but this version gives you a solid balance between speed and accuracy.

Write-Host ""

Write-Host "[4] Disk Health (Basic Status):"
Try {
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_DiskDrive | Select Model, Status
} Catch {
Write-Host "Could not retrieve disk health via WMI."

## üß¨ Disk Health Check (Windows)

```powershell
Write-Host "[4] Disk Health (Basic Status):"
```

üñ®Ô∏è **Prints a section header** for the basic disk health check using built-in WMI tools.

---

```powershell
Try {
    Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_DiskDrive | Select Model, Status
}
```

‚úÖ **Tries to fetch the disk drive model and basic health status**

- `Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_DiskDrive`  
  ‚Üí Talks to Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to list all physical disk drives.

- `Select Model, Status`  
  ‚Üí Narrows the output to just the **Model** (e.g., ‚ÄúSamsung SSD 870‚Äù) and the **Status** (e.g., ‚ÄúOK‚Äù, ‚ÄúPred Fail‚Äù).

üí° Why this matters:

- `"OK"` ‚Üí The drive thinks it's healthy.
- `"Pred Fail"` ‚Üí The drive is likely on its way out. Time to backup your data ASAP.

---

```powershell
Catch {
    Write-Host "Could not retrieve disk health via WMI."
}
```

üõë **Handles any errors gracefully** ‚Äî such as:

- Missing permissions
- WMI not available on the system
- Invalid device drivers

If something goes wrong, it prints a clean message instead of crashing.

---

```powershell
Write-Host ""
Write-Host "[4.1] Disk Health (Advanced - if smartmontools installed):"
Write-Host "Run: smartctl -H /dev/sda (Replace with correct disk name)"
```

üí° **Gives the user an advanced SMART health check option** using `smartctl` (from `smartmontools`).

- This does **not** run the command ‚Äî it just prints a helpful reminder for advanced users.
- `smartctl` provides full SMART diagnostics like temperature, bad sectors, SSD wear level, etc.

üß† **Example SMART Output:**

```bash
smartctl -H /dev/sda
=== START OF READ SMART DATA SECTION ===
SMART overall-health self-assessment test result: PASSED
```

### üîß TL;DR ‚Äì What This Code Block Does

| Line                            | What It Does                               | Why It‚Äôs There                                 |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `Try { Get-WmiObject... }`      | Queries Windows for basic drive status     | Works on most systems                          |
| `Catch { ... }`                 | Catches any WMI errors                     | Makes the script error-proof and user-friendly |
| `Write-Host "Run: smartctl..."` | Suggests an advanced tool for SMART health | For users needing full diagnostic insights     |
